A clean, self-contained snapshot of the working AIHLPR site, ready to hand to engineering.

## Page brand colors

Each capability page carries one accent colour, applied page-wide via `:root { --c: <hex>; }`:

| Page                                  | Accent    | Virtue |
|---------------------------------------|-----------|--------|
| `ai-applications-and-platforms.html`  | `#E91E63` | Warm Pink · approachable, inviting |
| `ai-workflow-infrastructure.html`     | `#9B59B6` | Friendly Purple · friendly, creative |
| `enterprise-ai.html`                  | `#3478E5` | Deep Trust Blue · reliability, trust |
| `prototype-to-production.html`        | `#CC418C` | Vibrant Magenta · engaging, warm |

The home page uses the shared system; each capability cap-strip card pulls the page's accent.

## Where the pages link to each other

- `Home.html` → all 4 capability pages (via `capabilities/...`)
- `Home.html` → 3 case studies (via `work/...`)
- Each capability page → `../AIHLPR Home.html` for the home link.
  **Note:** the current home file is named `Home.html`. Either rename to
  `AIHLPR Home.html` to match the existing links, or update all
  capability pages' `<a href>`s to point at `../Home.html`.

## Notable patterns engineering should know

- **Scroll-pinned panels** — used on:
  - `capabilities/ai-applications-and-platforms.html` (Section 2: "AI applications, shaped to the work")
  - `capabilities/enterprise-ai.html` (Generative AI section)
  Each is a copy column on the left and a sticky stage on the right; the
  active diagram swaps as a panel crosses viewport mid.

- **Flow spine** — vertical hairline in the left gutter of
  `capabilities/ai-workflow-infrastructure.html`. Connects every section's
  label-mono dot top to bottom; purple progress fills as you scroll.

- **Editorial table** — non-boxed table layout in
  `capabilities/enterprise-ai.html` ("Fits the systems already running"). One
  hub-and-spoke SVG above the table for visual lift.

## What was deliberately left out

- `archive/`, `export/`, `uploads/` — historical versions and source material
- `work-section/` — earlier exploration of a different work-section layout
- `capabilities/enterprise-ai-systems.html`, `operational-ai-systems.html`,
  `ai-applications-and-platforms-v1.html` — deprecated capability drafts
- `home-v2-hero.js`, `tweaks-panel.jsx`, `debug-*.png` — unused in current build

If engineering needs any of those, they're still in the source project.

## Read `_principles.md` first

It captures the editorial and visual contract every page follows:
no em dashes, no negative tone, no "built" copy, no AI-slop animation,
crisp diagram lines, one accent per page, etc. Stick to it on future changes.
